# Install Script Templates

This directory contains sanitized, reusable Bash templates for Linux application installs—both minimalist and modular/interactive. Use these as a starting point for your own system deployments. See script comments for guidance.

- `install-minimal-template.sh` — 90-line deployer for quick package/app setup.
- `install-modular-interactive-template.sh` — Advanced, highly-auditable skeleton with overrides, dependency handling, and post-install hooks.
