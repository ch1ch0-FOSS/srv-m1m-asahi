# srv-m1m-asahi: Fedora Asahi M1 Production Baseline

**Purpose:**  
This repository serves as both a professional public showcase of system administration and Linux infrastructure automation skills, and as a comprehensive fall-back for the solo admin (ch1ch0). It tracks all configuration, scripts, onboarding, and operational documentation for the Mac Mini (Apple Silicon M1) running Fedora Linux Asahi Remix.

## System Overview

- **Host:** Mac Mini (Apple Silicon M1), Fedora Linux Asahi Remix 42, kernel 6.16+
- **Primary storage:** `/mnt/data` (SSD, FHS-aligned)
- **Service stack:** Forgejo (git), Nextcloud (cloud/collab), plus future services for trading, 3D printing, automation/mining
- **Security:** SELinux enforcing, strict firewall, key-based SSH, two sudo-capable users
- **Metadata, user roles, SSH keys:** See `docs/system-setup-v1.0.md` & `docs/users.md`
- **Backup & recovery:** Fully automated, with docs/scripts tracking every step (`scripts/*`, `docs/restore.md`)

***

## Key Documentation

- **docs/system-setup-v1.0.md:**  
  Full baseline: devices, storage, users, security, FHS structure, deployment timeline, checkpoint verification, backup/restore summary

- **docs/ai-handoff.md:**  
  AI and admin handoff protocol. System state, backup plan, access policy, and operational standards for future handoff or disaster recovery. *All advice and changes must be reflected here*.

- **docs/restore.md:**  
  Step-by-step restore procedures for Nextcloud and Forgejo, with command references and audit notes.

- **docs/changelog/**:  
  Detailed, timestamped Markdown log of operational changes, upgrades, backups, security events, and major interventions.

- **docs/users.md:**  
  SSH user/key inventory for audit, with table of users, public keys, login policy, and admin/change notes.

- **docs/roadmap-v1.0.md:**  
  Project vision, contributions, upgrade/downtime tracking, and future buildout plans.

- **scripts/**:  
  All system-level and application onboarding scripts, backup automation, and checkpoint runners.  
  Scripts use robust logging and are tracked in source control for full repeatability.

- **skel.tpl/** and **tpl/**:  
  Shell script skeletons and logging/doc-string headers to support future onboarding and modular automation.

***

## Workflow and Best Practices

- **Change Control:**  
  Every system, admin, or AI change is tracked in Markdown in `docs/`, and in the corresponding bash script, then committed and pushed to Forgejo after each major session.

- **Audit & Recovery:**  
  All steps for service setup, backup, and restore are written for immediate use, audit readiness, and reproducibility.

- **World-Class Standards:**  
  SELinux and firewalld are always enabled. SSH is key-only. All storage is mounted/readied per FHS.  
  No change is "real" unless it's documented and committed.

***

## Private vs. Public Repos

- **srv-m1m-asahi:**  
  **Public-facing.** For professional portfolio, reproducibility, and disaster recovery for the solo admin.

- **admin (separate repo):**  
  Internal, not shared. For deeper world-class Linux admin scripts and historical/system microtasks.

***

## How To Use This Repo

1. **Read system-setup-v1.0.md and ai-handoff.md** for baseline and operational procedures.
2. **Follow restore.md** to recover from backups.
3. **Edit or add scripts and documentation** for every system change, onboarding, or new deployment.
4. **Commit and push** after every session—this repo is the canonical archive.
