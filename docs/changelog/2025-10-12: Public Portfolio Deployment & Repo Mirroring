- Edited documentation (README, system-setup-v1.0.md) to match current stack.
- Created personal GitHub repo mirrors for local Forgejo repos (`admin-toolkit`, `srv-m1m-asahi`).
- Generated and scoped new GitHub personal access token (PAT) for authenticated repo pushes.
- Linked dual git remotes for Forgejo â†” GitHub sync, configured credential helper.
- Verified public mirroring of project repos and live portfolio site.

**Why:**
- Milestone task for establishing public presence, proof-of-practice, and professional showcase.
- Feature expansion, infrastructure exposure, and external client verification.
- Audit trail, career positioning, and readiness for freelance and enterprise-grade work.

**How Verified:**
- Tested live portfolio at ch1ch0.me (HTTPS/SSL functional).
