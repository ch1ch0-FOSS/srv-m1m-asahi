### 2025-10-06: Finalize Automated Backup Scripts and Procedures  
**Who:** admin/ch1ch0  
**What Changed:**  
- Completed design, testing, and deployment of unified backup script `/usr/local/bin/backup_nextcloud_forgejo.sh` covering both Nextcloud and Forgejo services.  
- Added SELinux and permission fixes to allow proper operation under systemd timer.  
- Configured Forgejo dump command with explicit config path.  
- Corrected script to assign proper ownership on each backup run.  
- Fixed systemd timer unit to trigger nightly automated backups successfully.  
- Verified backup artifacts using manual runs and filesystem inspections.  
- Updated changelog and documentation files to reflect setup state and recovery procedures.  

**Why:**  
- To establish a robust, production-grade backup and disaster recovery baseline in compliance with audit requirements and best practices for Fedora Asahi M1 self-hosted server environment.  

**How Verified:**  
- Manual and scheduled test backups run with zero errors for file and DB dumps.  
- Backup files stored as compressed tarballs with correct ownership and permissions.  
- Logs examined to confirm consistent success and error resolution.  

**Recommendations/Follow-ups:**  
- Document detailed restore steps (done here).  
- Schedule monthly restore drills with changelog entries for ongoing audit readiness.  
- Extend backup strategy to new users/services (trading, canaan, bambulabs) as they are onboarded.  
- Periodically review and rotate credentials, hardening database and service passwords before production rollout.
