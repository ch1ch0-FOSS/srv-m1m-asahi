its really bleek at the moment

For the public-facing repo, the **system index** should act as a concise, readable “map” of published documentation, scripts, and checkpoints—free of sensitive information but giving any viewer a clear way to navigate your public project, see what’s available, and understand major milestones and artifacts.

Here’s a professional example template to use for your public index (`system-index-public.md`):

***

# Fedora Asahi Server – Public System Index

_Last updated: 2025-10-25_

***

## Project Overview

This repository documents the reproducible deployment and evolution of a Fedora Asahi server, suitable for cloud apps (Nextcloud), version control (Forgejo), and experimental AI-admin integrations. All content here is sanitized for public/educational use.

## Index of Public Artifacts

| Category | File/Directory | Purpose/Content |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| System Setup | `system-setup-v1.0-public.md` | Baseline architecture, storage, and privilege summary |
| Roadmap | `roadmap-v1.0-public.md` | High-level project plan and checkpoint breakdown |
| Readme | `README.md` | Repo introduction, getting started |
| Guides | `docs/guides/` | CLI, FHS, XDG, troubleshooting guides (sanitized) |
| Automation Scripts | `scripts/core/` | Installers for key apps (e.g. GNOME/KDE, vimb, etc.) |
| Desktop Verifications | `docs/wiki/screenshots/` | Proof-of-practice screenshots and fastfetch outputs |
| Changelog | `changelog/` | Summary of public changes, milestones, and updates |
| Templates | `tpl/public/` | General-use docs/scripts for learning/customizing |

## Major Public Checkpoints

- **Checkpoint 1:** System install, network config, SSH
- **Checkpoint 2:** User setup and hardening
- **Checkpoint 3:** Firewall, SELinux, system updates
- **Checkpoint 4:** Application installations (Nextcloud, Forgejo, OpenBB, Ollama)
- **Checkpoint 5:** Multi-DE proof (GNOME, KDE), AI-Coop integration start

***

## Usage

- **For learners or contributors:**
Read the *_public.md* files and guides for step-by-step recreation.
- **For recruiters or reviewers:**
Screenshots and logs in `/docs/wiki/screenshots` verify “proof of capability.”
- **For admins or AI:**
Review scripts in `/scripts/core` for FHS-compliant automation and install tasks.

***

## Notes

- Only sanitized, non-sensitive files and documentation are present in this index.
- Full audit, session, and ensemble logs remain private.
- Every major public update is timestamped in the public changelog.

***

This public index gives clear, compliant navigation and instantly demonstrates professionalism for viewers, collaborators, or future community contributors. You can expand each section with more files as your public documentation evolves, but **never include internal-only pathing, usernames, or operational secrets**.[^1][^2]
